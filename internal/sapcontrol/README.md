# SAPControl web service

The SAPControl web service is the most common interface to interact with SAP instances.
It offers a WSDL schema defining all the possible operations.

The [hooklift/gowsdl](https://github.com/hooklift/gowsdl) library was used to create the related golang code.
Find the complete auto-generated code in [./_generated_wsdl.go].

As using all the operations is not intended, a simplified version of it has been extracted.

## Autogenerated-code

Follow the next instructions to generated the code from the WSDL:

Given that the machine where the commands are executed has a SAP application instance running and is running under a SLES machine:

```
# Install golang (at least 1.20 version) and git
zypper in go1.23 git
# Download [hooklift/gowsdl](https://github.com/hooklift/gowsdl)
go install github.com/hooklift/gowsdl/cmd/gowsdl@latest
# Generated the code. The `00` in `50013` is the value of the instance number of the SAP instance running in the machine
~/bo/bin/gowsdl -p sapcontrol -o _generated_wsdl.go http://localhost:50013/?wsdl
# Copy the code from sapcontrol/_generated_wsdl.go
```
